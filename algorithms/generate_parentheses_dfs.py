#If you have two stacks, one for n "(", the other for n ")", you generate a binary tree from these two stacks of left/right parentheses to form an output string.
#
#This means that whenever you traverse deeper, you pop one parentheses from one of stacks. When two stacks are empty, you form an output string.
#
#How to form a legal string? Here is the simple observation:
#
#For the output string to be right, stack of ")" most be larger than stack of "(". If not, it creates string like "())"
#Since elements in each of stack are the same, we can simply express them with a number. For example, left = 3 is like a stacks ["(", "(", "("]

# @param {integer} n
# @return {string[]}
